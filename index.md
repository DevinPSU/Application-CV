**Objective**  
I am interested in studying proteins involved in bacterial signaling pathways.  
**Education**  
Nebraska Wesleyan University (NWU), Lincoln, NE  
Bachelor of Science Biochemistry & Molecular Biology ‘25  
Ph.D. Biochemistry & Molecular Biology The Pennsylvania State University  
Anticipated Graduation Date: May 2030

**Graduate Research** 

* **Graduate Student** (August 2025-Present)  
  * **Co-advised by Jean-Paul Armache & Katsuhiko Murakami (BMMB)**  
  * **South Frear, University Park, PA Pennsylvania University**  
* **Research Topic:** Cryo-EM data processing, experimental design, methodology development, protein purification and structural characterization. 

**Undergraduate Research Experience**

* **Undergraduate Student Researcher** (January 2024 \- August 2024\)  
  * **Nebraska Center for Integrated Biomolecular Communication (NCIBC) Undergraduate Research Fellow** (May-August 2024\) 

  **Beadle Center of University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) with Dr. Limei Zhang**

  **Research Topic:** Working on protein purification, and characterization of the SigM, RsmA proteins present in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

  **Research Goal:** Understanding the interactions between SigM and RsmA proteins thought to be involved in the pathway *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* uses to distribute antibiotic resistance. 

* Participated in NCIBC Funded Cryo-EM Workshop at University of Nebraska-Lincoln including hands-on experience with Vitrobot and Glacios and brief acquaintance with the software.   
  **Techniques Learned:** Western blotting, SDS-PAGE, Ni-NTA purification, Strep purification, computational characterization of proteins using Chimera X, Cryo-EM, Cell Overexpression and transformation.  
    
* **NSF Funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)** (May 2023 \- July 2023\)

  **Research Topic:** Characterizing the PilZ Domain Protein Interactions with Type IV Pili Effectors In Biased Twitching Motility In *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.   
  **Research Goal:** Worked with the proteins PilH and ChpB thought to be involved in the Type IV Secretion System used in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* for Directed Twitching Motility towards *Staphylococcus aureus*. This system is theorized to directly relate to the increased virulence of *P. aeruginosa* and the worsened clinical outcomes of infected patients.   
  **Techniques Learned:** Cell transformations, cell culturing, protein purification, SDS-PAGE, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry, pull-down assays, radioactive phosphorylation assays, High Performance Liquid Chromatography, UV Vis Spectroscopy, data interpretation, and data visualization.   
    
* **NSF Funded & CABBI RISE Funded Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP)** (May-Aug 2022\)

  **Research Topic:** Phenotyping and genotyping of transgenic sorghum for the use of renewable fuels.   
  **Research Goal:** Increase the amount of triacylglycerols in sorghum through the insertion of genes.   
  **Techniques Learned:** PCR, DNA gel electrophoresis, DNA extraction, lyophilizing, and gas chromatography.
